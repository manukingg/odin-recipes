    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Soft and crumbly chocolate walnut cake called Mishka, which means bear in Russian. Have to admit that after trying the original recipe, I wasn't quite impressed with this chocolate walnut cake. It turned out so dry, that I even used sugar syrup to moisten the top layer. Decided to do a few changes and share it with you.Hope you guys try and like it.</p>


    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <h3>For the dough:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup sour cream</li>
        <li>1 packet baking powder</li>
        <li>3 tablespoon margarine</li>
        <li>1 packet vanilla sugar</li>
        <li>3 glasses flour</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons cocoa</li>
        <li>1 glass sugar</li>
        <li>100 g nuts, chopped</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>For the cream</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups sour cream</li>
        <li>200 g sugar</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>For the glaze</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>100 g chocolate (block chocolate)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix the sour cream, baking powder, flour, vanilla sugar, sugar and margarine to form a batter. Divide the dough in two. Mix the cocoa in half. Divide each of the two halves into two parts again.</li>
        <li>Roll out the four parts to form bases. Sprinkle the nuts (two whites, two browns) on three bases and press down a little. Bake all bases individually at 220 ° C until golden yellow. Then cut round while hot, e.g., using a large plate.</li>
        <li>As soon as the bases have cooled down, mix the cream of sour cream and sugar. Brush the floors and the edges with it and stack them.</li>
        <li>For the glaze, heat the block chocolate in a water bath and spread it over the kitchen. It is best to serve the next day so that the cake can really pull through.</li>
    </ol>
